# Pokémon Palette Version

A small QOL hack that replaces the Gym Leaders' teams with teams based on colors.
Based on jojobear13's Shin Pokémon Red and Blue. Below is the original README file from Shin Pokémon Red and Blue.
It will give you all the engine changes, such as changes to the battle system.

- Pokémon now have unique sprites in the menu.
- Sky Attack is now 150 power and recharges after hitting.
- Leech Life is now 80 power.
- Absorb is now 40 power.
- Mega Drain is now 75 power.
- Counter now works on all physical moves.
- Added Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb and Dragonbreath.

# Shin Pokémon Red and Blue: Lite Patch

Version 1.23

Future bugfixes here will be eventually migrated to the Shin Pokemon Red/Blue master branch

Download the IPS patch file of the version you want and apply it to its respective USA rom.  
Always apply patches to a fresh USA ROM or else strange glitches will occur.  

***Includes Pokemon Green and Japanese Red!***
- The compiler primarily builds the graphics and cerulean cave layout back to the original japanese release.
- Pokedex entries adapt the original Green version text that was translated in Fire Red.
- Pokedex uses metric units.
- Apply the Green ips patch to a USA Blue rom. Apply the Red-JP ips patch to a USA Red rom.

***Now Includes Japanese Blue!***
- Primarily builds the lists for encounters, trades, and prizes that were in the never-localized japanese release.
- Pokedex uses metric units.
- Apply the ips patch to a USA Blue rom.

***Updating Your Save File***  
New patches might crash or have issues upon loading a save from a previous patch or an unpatched game.  
To prevent this from happening, prepare your save file in the following way:  
--> Deactivate all special options (such as 60fps mode and NPC toggles).  
--> Save in the outdoor Pallet Town map.  
You might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.  
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Pallet Town.  


#Compatibility Notes
-----------

- Compatible with original Gameboy hardware (DMG, Super, Pocket, Color, Advance, SP)
- Potentially compatible with Pokemon Stadium 1 & 2 (using original Nintendo hardware)
- Might be possible to use a save from vanilla USA red/blue with this rom hack 
  - Save outside in Pallet Town before transferring over
  - Use the Softlock Warp to clear any invisible walls
- New builds are tested and debugged with the BGB 1.5.8 emulator and verified using original hardware
- Certain emulators are known to cause bugs due to inaccuracies in replicating the original hardware
  - Goomba in particular is known to be problematic
  - Due to the number of emulators in existence, BGB will be used as the supported standard
- Link trading with an original retail cartridge appears to work properly on real hardware
- Link trading between the lite and master branches appears to work properly on real hardware
- Link battles are still largely untested, and they are unsupported in the following ways:
  - Link battling between a master branch build and any other non-master branch build
  - Link battling between a lite branch build and any other non-lite branch build
  - Link battling between builds of dissimilar revisions
- A revision control function has been added that will cancel unsupported cable links

#Bugfixes:
-----------

- Battle engine fixes
  - PP usage is now tracked for both wild and AI trainer pokemon
  - Moves no longer have a default 1/256 chance to miss
  - Fixed freeze that occurs in defense stat scaling (def < 4 glitch)
  - Enemy ai ignores type effectiveness for moves that have zero power
     - prevents things like spamming agility against poison pkmn
  - Enemy ai ignores super-effectiveness for moves that do static amounts of damage
  - Fixed skipping move-learn on level-up glitch. 
     - when gaining multiple levels at a time, each in-between level is incrementally checked for moves learned
     - this prevents a pkmn from skipping learnable moves if gaining multiple levels in battle
	 - also does this when evolving via level-up for the new evolution's movelist
  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore
  - The function that applies badge stat-ups now selectively boosts the correct stat when called during a stat-up/down effect
  - If player is frozen, the hyperbeam recharge bit is now cleared
     - now matches how enemy mon's recharge bit is cleared upon being frozen
     - this prevents getting stuck in a loop unable to do anything on your turn
  - Blaine will not use a healing item at full HP
  - The BIRD type has been reinstated and renamed to TYPELESS. It acts as a universally neutral type (particularly for Struggle)
  - AI trainers have priority on switching or using an item
  - AI type effectiveness function now takes type 1 and 2 into account together 
	 - Before AI would only look at the type it encountered first in a list search
     - AI will now treat a move as neutral if type 1 makes it supereffective but type 2 makes it not effective
  - Stat changes from burn and paralyze are applied when the ai sends out a pkmn with those conditions
  - AI routine #2 (prioritize buffing or use a status move) now activates on the 1st turn after sendout instead of the 2nd
  - New custom function for undoing the stat changes of burn and paralysis
    - undoing paralysis is accurate to within 0 to -3 points
    - undoing burn is accurate to within 0 to -1 point
  - PP-up uses are disregarded when determining to use STRUGGLE if one or more moves are disabled
  - AI will not do actions during Rage or when recharging
  - Fixed wrong crit damage for lvl > 127
  - Made adjustments to critical hit damage
    - Damage factor is now 2*(2*level)/5 + 4 instead of 2*(2*level)/5 + 2 to simplify some algebra
    - If non-crit damage would be >= crit damage, the regular modified stat values are applied instead

	
- Move fixes
  - Transform-related fixes:
    - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves).
    - Transform will no longer copy the opponent's Transform move. It's swapped-out for Struggle
    - Enemy DVs can no longer be manipulated by having it use transform multiple times
    - Fixed a conflict where transforming while disabled can leave the new moves disabled
    - Fixed a typo so now transformed 'mons retain their original palette
    - Fixed transformed 'mons reseting their moves when learning a level-up move
  - dire hit/focus energy now quadruples crit rate instead of quarters
  - sleep now normal-chance hits a pkmn recharging from hyperbeam, but has no effect if it's already status-effected
  - the fly/dig invulnerability bit is cleared when a pkmn hurts itself from confusion or is fully paralyzed
  - psywave damage is always min 1 be it an opponent or yourself (prevents desync)
  - Substitute-related fixes:
    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - Haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck (also fixes the sleep-trap glitch)
     - Fixed by allowing sleeping/frozen pkmn to use a move after haze restores them
     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage moves (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc) can no longer critically hit
  - fixed-damage moves now obey type immunities
  - fixed-damage moves now ignore effectiveness text & sfx
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss
  - The effects of Leech Seed and Toxic no longer stack
  - Trapping effects only clear the hyperbeam recharge bit on a hit, preventing its automatic use on a miss
  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered
  - To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)
  - Fixed an issue with Disable's counter on slower 'mons

	
- Graphical Fixes
  - Glitched sprites can no longer cause a buffer overflow that corrupts the hall of fame

  - Adjusted two spin-stop tiles in Viridian Gym
  - Made Agility's animation more apparent
  - On GBC, moves animations are colored according to type
  - Gym leader names have been restored on the trainer card
    - These were removed during localization as a simple and expedient solution
    - So this is more of a correction to the localization than a strict graphical error


- Item Fixes  
  - Great ball has a ball factor of 12 now
  - Stone evolutions cannot be triggered via level-up anymore
  - Ether and elixer now account for PP-ups used when determining if move is at full PP
  - EXP ALL fixes

	- no longer counts fainted pokemon when dividing exp
	- handles exp correctly when all your battle participants are knocked out
  - Fixed a bug where itemfinder can't locate objects with a zero x or y coord
  - Surfboard bugfixes:
	  - cannot use the surfboard if being forced to ride the bicycle
	  - no longer freezes the game when using it from the item menu to get back on land
	  - the menu text will glitch a little, but only for a split-second and does not impact gameplay

  - Full Restore when used in battle to heal HP now undoes the stat changes of brn/par
  - Pokedoll is disallowed during ghost marowak battle
  - PP-restoring items no longer affect transformed moves and only restore the original moves
  

- Audio fixes
  - Fuschia gym plays the correct sfx when getting the TM from Koga
  - Vermilion gym plays the correct sfx when getting the TM from Surge
  - Restored sfx for getting a badge
    - A sfx is supposed to play when getting a badge, but not for all gym leaders and the sfx used is inconsistent
	- Looks like the idea was dropped in development due to issues with having separate audio banks
	- However, there is a unique unused sfx in the battle audio bank that signifies getting some kind of important item
	- This is likely what was going to be used for getting a badge at some point, and it has been restored
  - Bike music stops playing now when going down a hole

  - Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
  - Upped the power of safari balls to account for lower ball factor

- Trainer ai routine #1 (recognition of stats, hp, and conditions) has been modified
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is heavily discouraged against non-sleeping opponents
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is slightly encouraged against a sleeping opponent
  - using a zero-power confusion effect move is heavily discouraged against confused opponents
  - moves that would miss against an active substitute are heavily discouraged
  - stat buff/debuffs are heavily discouraged if it would have no effect due to hitting the buff/debuff stage limit
  - heavily discourage double-using lightscreen, reflect, mist, substitute, focus energy, and leech seed
  - leech seed won't be used against grass pkmn
  - do not use moves that would be blocked by an active mist effect
  - rules for using healing moves:
    - heavily discourage healing if at max hp
	- slightly encourage healing if below 1/3 hp
	- slightly discourage healing if above 1/2 hp
  - heavily discourage using Counter against a non-applicable move
  - heavily discourage roar, teleport, & whirlwind
  - heavily discourage disable against a pkmn already disabled
  - Substitute discouraged if less that 1/4 hp remains
  - Will discourage using Haze if unstatus'd or has net-neutral or better stat mods
  - Will heavily discourage boosting defense against special, OHKO, or static-damaging attacks
  - Discourage exploding effects if faster than a player in fly/dig state
  - Randomly discourage usage of 2-turn moves when confused/paralyzed
  - 50% chance that the AI is blind to a player switching ir using an item

  - Thunder Wave is not used against immune types
  - Poisoning moves discouraged against poison types
  - AI layer 3 changes that affect most 0-power moves (with only a few exceptions like heal effects)

	- heavily discourages 0-power moves if below 1/3 hp
  - Added some strategy to handle when the player uses fly/dig
  - Slightly preference regular effectiveness moves if STAB exists (25% chance per move)

- Trainer ai routine #4 is no longer unused. It now does rudimentary trainer switching.
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is below 1/3 HP and player also outspeeds AI
  - chance to switch based on power of incoming supereffective move
  - 12.5% chance to switch if a move is disabled
  - 12.5% chance to switch if afflicted with leech seed
  - 34% chance to switch if afflicted with toxic poison
  - 25% chance to switch if opponent is using a trapping move
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is confused
  - on the lowest stat mod, 12.5% chance to switch per lowered stage
  - There is a chance for the AI to switch a sleeping pokemon based on the sleep counter
    -chance is 0% if counter <= 3
	-chance is 12.5% if counter > 3
  - Additionally, every pokemon in the enemy roster is scored 
    - based on various criteria to determine which mon gets sent out
	- score might dictate that the current mon is the best choice and abort switching
	- an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
	- enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
	- switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
  - AI scoring for switching puts a heavier penalty on potentially switching in a bad type matchup
  - AI scoring imposes a very heavy penalty for potentially switching in pokemon with less than 1/4 HP
  - AI switch scoring now penalizes bad match-ups between player and enemy 'mon types

- Trainer ai routine #3 added to the following trainer classes
  -brock, surge, sabrina, blaine
  -bruno, agatha

- Trainer ai routine #4 added to the following trainer classes
  -jr trainer M/F, pokemaniac, hiker, cueball, psychic, tamer, black belt, rocket, cooltrainer M/F, gentleman, channeler
  -all rival phases, all gym leaders, elite-4, prof.oak, chief
  
- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so allows for new functionality:
  - Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
  - Trainer pkmn can now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level
  - These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn
  - Originally these get reset every time the opponent send out a pkmn (even swithing)
  - Was never really noticed since most trainers never switch nor would have the opportunity
  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch

- Adjustments to learnsets and base stats
  - Mewtwo can learn Swift by TM 

- Engine changes just for developers
  - If wGymLeaderNo is set to 9 when loading a battle, then the final battle music will play
  - The trainer move engine has been backported from Yellow version; trainer movesets can now be fully customized
  - Improved exp calculation for developers who want a level cap between 101 and 255
    - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
	- Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
	- The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
	- For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
  - Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings
  - Adjusted daycare to allow exp values over $500000
  - Allow up to 8 digits when displaying experience on the status screen
  - Streamlined how the ghost marowak battle is triggered (now allows for non-ghost marowaks in pokemon tower)
  - Special damage effect now uses 2 bytes for damage instead of 1
  - Fixed Psywave underflow/overflow with levels of 0, 1, and above 170
  - Pokemon can now learn more than 1 more per level
  - The 1.5x EXP boost function now has overflow protection
  - EXP Gained can now print up to five digits instead of four
  - The "<LF>" character mapping can be used as a line-feed
